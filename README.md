Welcome to the Traffic Fatalities in Austin, Tx 2013-2019 project! Our mission is to delve deep into comprehensive datasets gathered by the city of Austin related to traffic violations and fatalities that took place from 2013 to 2018. 

Our goal is to explore key variables such as the lethality of the incident, type of violation, type of road being driven on, date, driver's license status, coordinate location within the city of Austin, and the time of day when these incidents occurred. By harnessing the power of data analysis and predictive modeling, our primary objective is to develop a sophisticated model that can accurately predict the likelihood of individuals being involved in a fatal accident within the city of Austin.
