## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
# Load the libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)

# Load data from .csv file
data <- read.csv("~/dataset_merge.csv")

# Create Plot 1: Number of Fatalities by Hour
data  %>% 
  filter(speeding != 'u') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = number_of_fatalities, fill = speeding)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Hour", y = "Number of Fatalities") +
  ggtitle("Number of Fatalities by Hour")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Make a bargraph for the total number of occurrences of fatal crashes at different times of day from 2013-2019

library(openxlsx)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

data <- read.csv("~/dataset_merge.csv")

# Remove rows with unknown values
clean_data <- data %>%
  filter(ran_red_light != "u")

# Extract the hour from the time column
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(hms(time)))  # Assuming "time" is in HH:MM format

# Create a bar graph
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = factor(hour), fill = ran_red_light)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Hour",
    y = "Count of Fatalities",
    title = "Total number of fatalities and time of occurrence across years 2013-2019",
    fill = "Ran Red Light"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("y" = "red", "n" = "black" )) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
